# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

- The game has two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- Each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The sum of the rolled numbers accumulates in the "Current" score for the active player.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
